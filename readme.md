To Do Chores
===================
Automate some tasks like gathering resources, cutting down trees, digging turfs etc

***IMPORTANT***

I forked the project because the original developer stopped maintaining it and i thought it was a great mod.
You can find the original at:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377330400
I modified the project for personal use but wanted to share some added features with the community

I will NOT fix "strange" bugs: if it works on my machine it is fine to me, you most likely have something wrong on yours, check your other mods. Otherwise, misfortune.
If it is a bug I can replicate I will fix it.

----------------------
1. Open Widget (default Key "V") 
2. Select Option
 in widget, column 1 is chores icon, column 2~5 is option icon. 
3. Start Chores
4. Don't Close Widget while do chores
5. after task end (or when you want), close widget ( Key "V") 

Open Mod in-game menu (default Key "O") for changing some options

* [ ]Auto Cooking?
